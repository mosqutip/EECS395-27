/* This function is called instead of res_search() when Exim is running in its
test harness. It recognizes some special domain names, and uses them to force
failure and retry responses (optionally with a delay). Otherwise, it calls an
external utility that mocks-up a nameserver, if it can find the utility.
If not, it passes its arguments on to res_search(). The fake nameserver may
also return a code specifying that the name should be passed on.

Background: the original test suite required a real nameserver to carry the
test zones, whereas the new test suit has the fake server for portability. This
code supports both.

Arguments:
  domain      the domain name
  type        the DNS record type
  answerptr   where to put the answer
  size        size of the answer area

Returns:      length of returned data, or -1 on error (h_errno set)
